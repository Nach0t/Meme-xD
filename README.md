# Meme-xD Project

## Overview

Inspired by the whimsical world of internet memes, particularly those from Team Fortress 2 and the universal humor surrounding coconuts, the Meme-xD project leverages TensorFlow to bring an innovative twist to image processing. At its heart, it's a playful yet sophisticated system that can predict and classify image content, but with a catch â€“ it's designed to work with a specific image, `coco.png`, turning the concept of a traditional calculator on its head. This project showcases how TensorFlow and machine learning can be applied in fun, creative ways, transcending conventional boundaries.
